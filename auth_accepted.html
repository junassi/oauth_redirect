    <h1>Authorization Successful!</h1>
    <p>Thank you for authorizing ZenDropBot OAuth Test.</p>
    <p>You can now return to the application.</p>
    <p>(If you are seeing this page directly, it means the authorization code has been passed. In a live application, you would typically be redirected back to the app or this page would automatically close after processing the code.)</p>
    <p><strong>Note: This application is currently in a testing phase.</strong></p>
